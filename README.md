### Heyo! I'm Ben Haynes, project lead of [Directus](https://directus.io) 👋

I created Directus way back in 2004 (before smartphones or headless CMS), to make development more efficient for our agency projects. Much has changed since those early days, but my focus still remains on building the ideal platform for intuitively managing pure SQL database content.
